The waveform of fMRI signals using blood-oxygenation-level-dependent contrast has been considered too “sluggish” to infer the temporal information of neuronal activity reliably. This repository provides data to challenge this view. Specifically, we sampled fMRI signals at the rate of 10-Hz in a visuomotor task and calibrated the vascular reactivity with a breath-hold task. We found significantly sequential activation of the lateral geniculate nucleus and visual cortex in the visual pathway with an inter-regional latency of 496 ms, followed by the activation of the sensorimotor cortex lagging by 464 ms. The inter-regional fMRI timing was correlated with the behavioral reaction time. In sum, fMRI signals have accurate temporal information in hundreds of milliseconds related to neuronal activities and behavior after controlling the vascular reactivity.
